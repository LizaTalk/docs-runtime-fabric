Review the following table of limitations before installing, configuring, and managing Anypoint Runtime Fabric. 

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Limitation | Description | Enforced by Runtime Fabric
| Node count | The maximum number of nodes is 400. | Recommended
| Node types | VM-based nodes are required. For example, Fargate is not supported. | Yes
| Replicas per application | The maximum number of replicas per application is 8. | Yes
| Replicas per node | The maximum number of replicas that can be deployed per node is 40.

Run no more than 20 - 25 replicas per core, up to a maximum of 40 replicas per node, to allow core sharing across replicas when needed for bursting. This ensures the Runtime Fabricâ€™s internal components that run on each worker node are not overloaded by too many replicas. | Recommended
| Associated environments per Runtime Fabric | You can associate a Runtime Fabric with up to 100 environments in any Business Group. For example, if you associate a development and a production environment with Org A and a dev environment with Org B, that is three environment associations. | Yes
| Business groups | You can create up to 50 Runtime Fabrics per org in a Business Group. Any sub org can contain up to 50 Runtime Fabrics, in addition to any shared by another sub org. For example, if you have parent Org A and its child Org B, you can have 50 Runtime Fabrics in Org A and 50 in Org B. You can also share all 50 Runtime Fabrics from Org A with Org B, and as a result, you will see 100 Runtime Fabrics in total in the list view of Org B. | Yes
