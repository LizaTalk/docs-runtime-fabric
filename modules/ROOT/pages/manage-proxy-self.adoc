= Managing Proxies on Runtime Fabric

Runtime Fabric uses two types of proxies when running and hosting applications:

* System proxies: include proxies that enable connectivity among Kubernetes cluster services, including the Docker daemon and other internal components. When using Runtime Fabric you are responsible for configuring and managing system proxies.
* Application proxies: include proxies that enable connectivity to applications running on Runtime Fabric.

You can configure the proxy settings used by Runtime Fabric outbound connections to the internet. This includes both HTTP proxies for connecting to the Anypoint Platform control plane and SOCKS5 proxies for sending metrics and logs to Anypoint Monitoring. You can also configure proxies for applications.
