= Deploy an Application to Runtime Fabric using Maven (Mule 4)

Runtime Fabric supports using Mule Maven Plugin 3.x to manage and deploy Mule applications. The information in this topic is specific to deploying a Mule application to Mule runtime engine 4.x.

To deploy Mule 3 applications using Mule Maven Plugin 2.x, see xref:deploy-maven-3.x.adoc[Deploy an Application to Runtime Fabric using Maven (Mule 3)]

== Prerequisites

* Ensure that the Mule Maven Plugin is added to your project
+
See <<add-mmp, Add the Mule Maven Plugin to a Mule Project>> for instructions.
* The application is already published in Exchange +
** To do this from Studio, see xref:studio::export-to-exchange-task.adoc[Publishing a Project to Exchange]. +
** To do this using Maven, see xref:exchange::to-publish-assets-maven.adoc[Publish and Deploy Exchange Assets Using Maven].
+
[NOTE]
Studio allows you to select only two project types when uploading an application to Exchange: `example` and `template`. To specify a different project type, publish your application using Maven.
