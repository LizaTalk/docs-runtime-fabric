On Runtime Fabric instances running version 1.3.60 and later, you can use the Runtime Fabric *Settings* page in Runtime Manager to enable mutual 
authentication for the cluster. Mutual authentication improves the security of communication between Runtime Fabric and Anypoint Platform, and is highly recommended.

Before you enable mutual authentication, verify the following endpoint and port is reachable from your Runtime Fabric:

* US control plane
** `configuration-resolver.prod.cloudhub.io`
* EU control plane
** `configuration-resolver.prod-eu.msap.io`

You can use the latest xref:install-rtfctl.adoc[rtfctl] to help validate all required endpoints are reachable:

----
cd /opt/anypoint/runtimefabric
./rtfctl update
./rtfctl test outbound-network
----
