By design, Runtime Fabric automatically provides multiple aspects of environment hardening for your Mule installation. 
For example, by leveraging Docker and Kubernetes, app isolation is achieved by default.  

The following hardening checklist provides additional information about environment hardening already provided by 
Runtime Fabric, and specifies Runtime Fabric coverage as well as areas that require additional configuration.

== Hardening Checklist

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Hardening Step | Action Required
| Run Mule as a Non-privileged User. | RTF provides this functionality.
| Install Mule as a Service |	RTF provides this functionality by deploying a Mule runtime for each application within its own container.
| Configure Mule to write logs or temporary files within appropriate locations. Configure logs, passwords, and keystore files. | RTF provides this functionality.  Mule writes to a temporary file system that is deleted when the application terminates. Monitoring information is collected from a sidecar agent in a specific location on disk where metrics are outputted and stored. Logs are collected from standard out and standard error streams.
| In some situations, you must configure usernames, passwords, and keystores on Mule. Usually, these settings are made available externally, so that dev/ops can change these settings. |	RTF provides this functionality. Refer to xref:manage-secure-properties.adoc[Manage Secure Properties in Runtime Fabric] for additional information.
| Manage certificates in a keystore file. | This is supported on RTF, but you are responsible for importing the certificates into the keystore. In addition, RTF includes a load balancer which can handle SSL termination for all Mules deployed within it.
| Use a separate property file to store usernames and passwords and secure it using file system permissions. | RTF provides this functionality. Refer to xref:manage-secure-properties.adoc[Manage Secure Properties in Runtime Fabric] for additional information.
