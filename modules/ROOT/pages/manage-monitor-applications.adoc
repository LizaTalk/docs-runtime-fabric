= Monitoring Applications Deployed to Runtime Fabric

Anypoint Runtime Fabric provides customers with varying observability solutions depending on their needs.

== Anypoint Monitoring

By default, Runtime Fabric sends application metrics to Anypoint Monitoring. Titanium-plan customers also have application logs automatically sent to Anypoint Monitoring by default. For metrics and logs to be sent to Anypoint Monitoring, outbound network connectivity must be available, as described in xref:use-anypoint-monitoring.adoc[].

== Export Telemetry Externally

You can export telemetry externally by using a Log4j appender to integrate your logging system with applications deployed to Runtime Fabric. For information about configuring `log4j2.xml`, refer to the xref:use-log4j-appender.adoc[Use Log4j Appender] documentation.
