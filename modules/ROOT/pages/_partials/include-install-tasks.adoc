== Insert the Mule License Key

If you didnâ€™t add the Mule license key during install, you can add it using the `rtfctl` command line utility or Helm.

Before you install the license key, encode it to Base64 format.

=== Encode the License Key

* On MacOS, run the following command:
+
[source,copy]
----
base64 -b 0 -i <license-file>
----
+
* On Unix, run the following command:
+
[source,copy]
----
base64 -w0 <license-file>
----
+
* On Windows, choose one of the following:

** Use a WSL or Cygwin shell that includes the base64 tool and use the above Unix command.
** Use the base64.exe program included with Windows git (C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin).
** Use the following Powershell command:
+
[source,copy]
----
$BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE=[convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path "license.lic" -Encoding byte))
----

=== Apply the License Key from the OpenShift Console

. Navigate to the Runtime Fabric operator.
. Select the namespace where the Runtime Fabric instance is installed.

=== Apply the License Key Using Helm

To apply the license using Helm, run the following command:

[source,copy]
----
helm upgrade runtime-fabric rtf/rtf-agent --set muleLicense=$BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE -n rtf --reuse-values
----
// end::licenseKey[]

// tag::ingressResource[]

== Configure the Ingress Resource Template

If your ingress controller requires custom annotations and ingress class definition, follow the instructions in xref:custom-ingress-configuration.adoc[Defining a Custom Ingress Configuration].

[NOTE]
====
For GKE customers, the ingress controller included with GKE will provision a separate HTTP load balancer per application by default. Please read this link:https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/Default-Ingress-Controller-Behavior-with-Runtime-Fabric-on-GKE[KB article] for more details.

== Validate Your Runtime Fabric

After completing the installation, your Runtime Fabric should be activated within your Anypoint organization. To validate your installation, go to Anypoint Runtime Manager and confirm that the status of the Runtime Fabric is `Active`.

Before deploying an application to your Runtime Fabric:

. Associate the Runtime Fabric with at least one Anypoint environment.
. Review and update the Inbound Traffic settings based upon your Kubernetes environment.
. Deploy an application to verify that Runtime Fabric is installed and configured correctly.
