== Insert the Mule License Key

[IMPORTANT]
====
The procedures in the section must be performed by an IT administrator.
====

After the installation has completed succesfully, insert the Mule license key.

. Base64 encode the new Mule `.lic` license file provided by MuleSoft:
+
* On MacOS, run the following command:
+
[source,copy]
----
BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE=$(base64 -b0 license.lic)
----
+
* On Unix, run the following command:
+
[source,copy]
----
BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE=$(base64 -w0 license.lic)
----
+
* On Windows, choose one of the following:

** Use a WSL or Cygwin shell that includes the base64 tool and use the above Unix command.
** Use the base64.exe program included with Windows git (C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin).
** Use the following Powershell command:
+
[source,copy]
----
$BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE=[convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path "license.lic" -Encoding byte))
----

. On the controller node acting as the leader during installation (the installer node), use the `rtfctl` utility with the Base64 value of your license key: 
+
[source,copy]
----
rtfctl apply mule-license $BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE
----

. To verify the Mule license key has applied correctly, run:
+
[source,copy]
----
rtfctl get mule-license
----

== Configure the Ingress Resource Template

[IMPORTANT]
====
The procedures in this section should be performed by an IT administrator.
====

If your ingress controller requires custom annotations and ingress class definition, follow the instructions in xref:custom-ingress-configuration.adoc[Defining a Custom Ingress Configuration].

[NOTE]
====
For GKE customers, the ingress controller included with GKE will provision a separate HTTP load balancer per application by default. Please read this link:https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/Default-Ingress-Controller-Behavior-with-Runtime-Fabric-on-GKE[KB article] for more details.

== Validate Your Runtime Fabric

[IMPORTANT]
====
The procedures in this section should be performed by an IT administrator.
====

After completing the installation, your Runtime Fabric should be activated within your Anypoint organization. To validate your installation, go to Anypoint Runtime Manager and confirm that the status of the Runtime Fabric is `Active`.

Before deploying an application to your Runtime Fabric:

. Associate the Runtime Fabric with at least one Anypoint environment.
. Review and update the Inbound Traffic settings based upon your Kubernetes environment.
. Deploy an application to verify that Runtime Fabric is installed and configured correctly.
// end::validate[]

// tag::namespace[]

== Create A Namespace for Runtime Fabric 

You must create a namespace named `rtf` in your Kubernetes cluster. This namespace is where you install Runtime Fabric components. 

To create the namespace, run: 

[source,copy]
----
kubectl create ns rtf 
----
// end::namespace[]

// tag::pullsecret[]

== Create A Docker Pull Secret 

After you create the namespace, create a pull secret so you can retrieve the Docker images needed to install and run Runtime Fabric. 

The default registry URL is `rtf-runtime-registry.kprod.msap.io`. If youâ€™re using a local registry, specify those values here. 

To create the pull secret, run:

[source,copy]
----
kubectl create secret docker-registry <pull_secret> --namespace rtf --docker-server=<docker_registry_url> --docker-username=<docker_registry_username> --docker-password=<docker_ registry_password>
----
// end::pullsecret[]
